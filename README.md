## ‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Data Usage

This project includes an example dataset: `data/sheema.xlsx`.

- It is a **sample schema file** with placeholder structure used by the report.
- You **should not replace this file** with your actual salary data unless you understand how the report's Power Query logic is built.

If you want to:
- **Adjust salary amounts, bonuses, or tax logic**, do so **inside Power BI** via:
  - **Transform Data** (Power Query Editor)
  - DAX measures
  - Parameter tables

‚ùó Do not modify `sheema.xlsx` directly unless you're extending the schema.  
Instead, adapt calculations using Power BI‚Äôs built-in functions for maximum flexibility and consistency.
